Dear Professor Butler:

Attached please find the manuscript of a research note introducing a dataset on Mexican municipal election vote returns since 1979. Primary sources routinely publish on the web the information in this dataset. But no source systematically covers the 2,500+ municipalities of all 32 states for nearly half a century with unified criteria, while making it publicly accessible. My dataset does this, also including the names of elected municipal presidents since 1989.

I am submitting an anonimized cover page, as requested by MS/EM's submission instructions. Yet the nature of the piece hardly makes it suitable for full anonimity, since reviewers will likely need to revise the live repository in order to judge on the merits of the substance. Any clever person will easily deduce my identity from the text. I believe that should not be a problem.

Best,

Eric Magar
Professor, ITAM
