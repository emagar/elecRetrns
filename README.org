<sup><sub>2025-06-02</sub></sup> Added preliminary returns and winners for 2025 municipal elections in Durango and Veracruz.  

<sup><sub>2024-04-12</sub></sup> Changed ~nl2018aymu~, ~mex2021aymu~, and ~mic2021aymu~ in source to reflect voided stations. Two victors changed in ~aymu1989-on.incumbents~ (in General Zuazua and Angangueo). Thanks to Juan Pablo Figueroa for pointing this.

<sup><sub>2024-02-29</sub></sup> Completes municipal /listas nominales/ for the study of turnout. 

# <sup><sub>2023-12-01</sub></sup> Electoral party/coalition of ayuntamiento incumbents added.

<sup><sub>2023-11-11</sub></sup> [[codebook][*Codebook*]] updated, with a printable flier.

# <sup><sub>2023-05-26</sub></sup> *v.hat and alpha regressions*, summaring each unit's electoral history, migrated from [[https://github.com/emagar/mxDistritos]]. Despite relying on electoral maps to maintain unit geography longitudinally constant, these are statistics directly relevant to this repository's content. 
# Estimates and predictions for districts added, including predicted votes for the suspicious 1988 election, and the script for split secciones was finalized. 

<sup><sub>2023-03-10</sub></sup> *Inspect election returns online in Google sheets [[https://emagar.github.io/view-in-gSheets/][here]] (Beta)*

# <sup><sub>2023-02-22</sub></sup> *Voting station latitude/longitude* added for federal elections between 2006 and 2018 (excluding 2012, source needs debugging).

# <sup><sub>2022-11-18</sub></sup> *Casilla-level lista nominal* added to 1991-2003 federal deputy files.

# *Special municipal elections* in 2021/22 added, elected mayors updated. 

# *State-level presidential and senate returns* cleaned and updated.

# *Dzitbalché*, a new municipality in the state of Campeche, now has inegi code 4013.

# *Bug fixed* in fourth coalition vote aggregation/splitting (affected 5 municipalities only). 

# *Letters of intent* to run again for reelection (/cartas de intención/, see [[http://eleccionconsecutiva.diputados.gob.mx/contendientes][this]]) now systematized in ~data/dfdf1997-on.incumbents.csv~. See codebook below.

# *Reelection in 2021-22 info is here* ~data/aymu1989-on.incumbents.csv~ reports mayors reelected/beaten in states that dropped term limits in races concurrent with this year's midterm election. And ~data/dfdf1997-on.incumbents.csv~ does the same for federal deputies.

*New script* ~code/extract-state-yr-mu-returns.r~  exports municipal election returns. Focus in a single state-year allows votes received by each party across municipalities grouped in one column each --- easier to describe.

- Citation for the data: see 'About' on the repository landing page
The repository contains voting data for recent Mexican elections for certain offices at different levels of aggregation. Data has been compiled from many sources. More recent years tend to be coded from official vote returns. Earlier elections tend to be from secondary sources (see Souces section). Data includes district-level federal deputy vote returns since 1979 and district-level presidential vote returns since 2006; and municipality-level municipal president vote returns (except in the state of Nayarit, votes cast for municipal president also elect a municipal council in a fused ballot). 

/Important note:/ older incarnations of this repository contain LFS (Large File System) files. Make sure to install [[https://git-lfs.github.com/][LFS]] in your machine before checking out older commits of the repository.
* How to cite the data
This repository is under the [[https://pitt.libguides.com/openlicensing/MIT][MIT license]] (see the LICENSE document for details). You are free to download and modify the data and code provided you give proper credit to this source. Unless otherwise noted in the file descriptor, the cite is Eric Magar (2018) Recent Mexican election vote returns repository, [[https://github.com/emagar/elecReturns]].
* File naming conventions
In general, file names identify the office elected (i.e., *df*, *se*, *pr*, *dl*, *go*, *ay* for /diputados federales/, /senadores/, /presidente/, /diputados locales/, /gobernador/, and /ayuntamiento/, respectively), followed by the unit of observation (i.e., *ed*, *df*, *dl*, *mu*, *de*, *se*, *ca* for /estado/, /distrito federal/, /distrito local/, /municipio/, /demarcación/, /sección electoral/, and /casilla/, respectively), then the years included.

So, for example ~aymu1970-on.csv~ are /ayuntamiento/ votes at the municipio level since 1970.
* Files in the repository
** Municipal office election returns
Municipal election data updated to 2022. Other than in the states of Chihuahua and Nayarit, municipal /ayuntamientos/ are elected in fused ballots for a /presidente municipal/ and a variable fraction of the municipal council (/regidores/ and /síndicos/). The other fraction of the municipal council is allocated by proportional representation. 

Chihuahua since 1998 also concurrently elects one /síndico/ per municipality in a separate ballot. The election is by plurality in the municipality at large. 

Nayarit since 2008 elects a fraction of municipal council members in single-member plurality districts called /demarcaciones/, the other fraction by proportional representation (ballot fused with the municipal president). 

Two versions of municipal election returns are included: one with votes reported by candidate, another reported by party (they may differ whenever coalitions competed). The script [[./code/ay.r][~code/ay.r~]] was used for these manipulations:
- [[./data/aymu1989-present.coalAgg.csv][~data/aymu1970-on.coalAgg.csv~]] = /ayuntamiento/ election returns, coalition votes aggregated by candidate.
- [[./data/aymu1989-present.coalSplit.csv][~data/aymu1970-on.coalSplit.csv~]] = /ayuntamiento/ election returns, coalition votes split among parties where source permits.
- [[./data/aymu1989-present.incumbents.csv][~data/aymu1989-on.incumbents.csv~]] = names of elected municipal officers (/presidente municipal/ only) since 1989. Includes reelection status since 2018.

** Congressional election returns
Congressional election data updated to 2021. A mixed majority system is in place since 1979 for the chamber of deputies, since 1997 for the senate (Weldon 2001 describes the system well). 300 deputy seats are elected by plurality rule in single member districts. Two versions of federal deputy returns are included: one with district votes aggregated by candidate, another by party (the script [[./code/ay.r][~code/df.r~]] was used for these manipulations):

* Historical party performance statistics
Measures of recent electoral history, that [[https://emagar.github.io/residuales-2018-english/][this blog entry]] describes, offer indicators of party competitiveness at different units of aggregation. This includes quantities of substantive interest, such as parties' predicted vote share in the unit (~v.hats~) based on their performance in the previous five congressional elections, and how sensitive the party's vote share in the unit is to national vote swings (~alphas~) between 1994 and 2021.

** Backwards predictions
Vote returns prior to 1991 are unavailable at lower units of aggregation. Pre-2009 ~v.hats~ are obtained by using same general approach, but backwards, "predicting" from subsequent party performance. Year t's predicted vote (up to 2006) is a linear projection of the unit's vote in the next five elections (years t+15, t+12 ... t+3).

* Codebook<<codebook>>
Most variables are included in all files. Refer here for guidance. Printable codebook [[file:./codebook-flier.pdf][here]]. 
** Unit IDs
- /edon/ = state numeral 1:32.
- /edo/ = state abbreviation (may differ from commonly used abbreviations, eg. Chiapas is `cps' instead of `chis', so that sorting alphabetically preserves the order set by /edon/).
- /disn/ = district identifier = /edon/ * 100 + two digit district numeral.
- /cab/ = cabecera, district's administrative center.
- /inegi/, /ife/ = municipal identifier codes used by the INEGI and the IFE/INE, respectively.
- /mun/ = municipality's name.
- /emm/ = unit's identifying code. It concatenates the state's /edo/ abbreviation (then a hyphen) two sequential digits for the election cycle (then a period) and, depending on the level of observation, the /inegi/ or district identifier. Using /emm/ as sort criterion returns a state-time-unit ordering.
- /demar/ = demarcación identifier = /inegi/ + 1/100 demarcación numeral (used for Nayarit municipal elections only).
- /seccion/ = voting precinct identifier = /edon/ * 10000 + sección electoral numeral (as set by IFE/INE).
- /casilla/ = polling station identifier (as set by IFE/INE). There are four types of stations, coded B for /Básica/, C for /Contigua/, E for /Extraordinaria/, and S for /Especial/. See IFE's own description [[https://portalanterior.ine.mx/archivos2/Alterna/2016/PREP/CentroDeAyuda/Extraordinaria/rsc/pdf/tipos_casillas.pdf][here]].
# - /circ/ = secondary, proportional representation congressional district (/circunscripción plurinominal/) to which the primary congressional district belongs to. 
- /latitude/, /longitude/ = coordinates indicating a polling booths's north--south and east--west position in a map. Available for federal casilla-level returns in the 2006, 2009, 2015, and 2018 elections. 
** Temporal IDs
- /yr/, /mo/, /dy/ = year, month, day of the election. 
- /date.el/, /date.in/ = date of the election and start of term, respectively.
- /dextra/ = dummy equal 1 for special elections (/elección extraordinaria/), 0 otherwise.
- /danul/ = dummy equal 1 for voided elections, 0 otherwise.
** Voting
- /v01/, /v02/, ... = raw vote for candidate 1, 2, etc.
- /l01/, /l02/, ... = label of candidate 1's, 2's, ... party or coalition.
- /c01/, /c02/, ... = candidate 1's, 2's, ... name.
- /efec/ = effective vote total, the sum of raw votes minus votes for write-in candidates minus invalid ballots. It is the denominator to compute vote shares.
- /lisnom/ = unit's total eligible voters (/lista nominal/).
- /nr/ = votes for write-in candidates (/candidatos no registrados/, void in Mexican election law).
- /nul/, /nulos/ = invalid ballots (/votos nulos/).
- /tot/ = total raw votes.
- /win/ = winner's party or coalition.

- /bhat.pan/, /bhat.left/ = slope estimate of the party's autoregressive linear model for the unit. The PRI used as reference vote and has no slope estimate. 
- /alphahat.pan/, /alphahat.pri/, /alphahat.left/ = party's /alpha/ estimated for the unit. 
- /betahat.pan/, /betahat.left/ = party's /beta/ estimate for the unit. The PRI used as reference vote and has no /beta/ estimate.

** Candidates and incumbents
- /incumbent/, /runnerup/ = winning and runner-up candidates' names.
- /propietario/, /suplente/ = primary and substitute candidate's name, respectively.

- /dreran/ = dummy equal 1 if incumbent ran again in the next consecutive race for the same office. 
- /dreelected/ = dummy equal 1 if incumbent won the next consecutive race for the same office. 
- /dcarta/ = dummy equal 1 if member of Congress filed a letter of intent with the chamber's Junta to run for office again; 0 otherwise. Inapplicable before 2018. See [[http://eleccionconsecutiva.diputados.gob.mx/contendientes][this]].

- /ddied/ = dummy equal 1 if incumbent died in office, 0 otherwise.
- /prior.inc.part/ = if an incumbent was on the ballot in the race immediately prior to the current observation, this reports its electoral party or coalition.
- /inc.part.after/ = if an incumbent was on the ballot in the race immediately after the current observation, this reports its electoral party or coalition.

* Coding procedure for the incumbent's status<<status-rules>>
In files ~data/aymu1985-on.incumbents.csv~ and ~data/dfdf1997-on.incumbents.csv~, variable /race.after/ reports what occured at the end of the incumbent's term. It takes one of the following categories: 
1. `Reran-beaten' = the incumbent re-ran and lost; 
2. `Reelected' = the incumbent re-ran and won; 
3. `Dead' = the incumbent died in office;
4. `Hi-office' = the incumbent ran for higher office in the next cycle; 
5. `Out' = the incumbent withdrew or was not renominated in the next cycle; 
6. `Term-limited' = incumbent ineligible for reelection due to a term limit; 
7. `Uyc' = municipio quit the popular election of authorities in the next cycle, appointing offices according to community rules (/usos y costumbres/);
8. A year numeral = still early to know the incumbent's status (and the year of the next race).
In categories other than the first two above, a suffix may be present: 
- Suffix '-p-lost' indicates that the party lost the subsequent race (or, in case of incumbents elected by a multi-party coalition, that none of them won or was part of the winning coalition). 
- Suffix '-p-won' indicates that the party won the subsequent race (or, in case of incumbents elected by a multi-party coalition, that one of them won or at least one of them was in the winning coalition).

* Procedimiento para codificar el estatus del ocupante<<status-rules-esp>>
En el archivo ~data/aymu1985-on.incumbents.csv~, la variable /race.after/ indica el estatus del ocupante en la elección subsecuente. El estatus puede ser una de las categorías siguientes: 
1. `Reran-beaten' = el ocupante volvió a contender y perdió; 
2. `Reelected' = el ocupante volvió a contender y ganó; 
3. `Dead' = el ocupante falleció durante su mandato;
4. `Hi-office' = el ocupante contendió el siguiente ciclo por otro cargo de elección (p.ej. gobernador o senador);
5. `Out' = el ocupante se retiró o no fue repostulado por el partido; 
6. `Term-limited' = el ocupante estaba constitucionalmente impedido para aspirar a reelegirse consecutivamente; 
7. `Uyc' = el muicipio abandonó en el siguiente ciclo la elección popular de sus autoridades, nombrándolos según usos y costumbres; 
8. Un número de año = aún es prematuro conocer el estatus (y el año de la próxima elección).
En las categorías 3 en adelante, un sufijo puede estar presente: 
- El sufijo '-p-lost' indica que el partido perdió la elección subsecuente (o, para ocupantes electos por una coalición multi-partidista, que ninguno de esos partidos ganó o fue parte de la coalición ganadora). 
- El sufijo '-p-won' indica que el partido ganó la elección subsecuente (o, para ocupantes electos por una coalición multi-partidista, que uno de esos partidos ganó o que por lo menos uno fue parte de la coalición ganadora).
